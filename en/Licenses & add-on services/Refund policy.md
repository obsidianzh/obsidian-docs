## Obsidian Catalyst and Unlimited

[[Catalyst license]] purchases and Obsidian Unlimited donations are to support Obsidian's development. ==They are not refundable.==

Although they might give you exclusive early access to insider builds or feature betas, we do not sell them as a product.

We cannot provide refunds for Catalyst purchases. Thanks for your understanding!

If there is any issue with a transaction, please reach out to support@obsidian.md or on Discord.

## All other services

For all other services and licenses, including [[Commercial license]], [[Introduction to Obsidian Publish|Obsidian Publish]], and [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]], you can request a full refund within 3 days of purchase with no questions asked.

To request a refund, log into your account [on our Account page](https://obsidian.md/account), and use the **Invoices & Refunds** option. If a payment is refundable, a link to request refund will appear.
