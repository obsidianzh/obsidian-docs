[[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] keeps a history of all the changes made to your notes. Sync regularly checks for new changes to your notes and creates a new version.

If you accidentally delete a note, or you want to go back to a previous version of your note, you can restore a note from the version history.

Older versions of your notes are retained for up to a year.
