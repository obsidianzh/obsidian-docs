Use `%%` to enclose comments, which will be parsed as Markdown, but will not show up in the preview.

```md
Here is an inline comment: %%You can't see this text%% (can't see it in preview)

Here is a block comment: (can't see it in preview either)
%%
It can span
multiple lines
%%
```

Here is an inline comment: %%You can't see this text%% (can't see it in preview)

%%

multiple lines
%%

> [!note]
> For ease of editing, comments remain visible in the Live Preview mode.
