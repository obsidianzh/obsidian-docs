Released on 2022/03/01.

## Improvements

- `Enter` on empty line now exits blockquotes again, and `Shift+Enter` has been improved to work as "soft line wrap" where it will smartly add indentation to keep you in the same list/blockquote but on the next line.

## No longer broken

- Fixed outgoing links unlinked mention section stopped working.
- Fixed dollar signs in wikilinks parsed as math.
