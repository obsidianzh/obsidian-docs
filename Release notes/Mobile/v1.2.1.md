**Core update**
- Includes all new functionality and bug fixes up to Obsidian Desktop v0.14.6.
- Tapping the three dot more options icon now brings up the menu related to this file, rather than the right sidebar. You can get to the right sidebar by long-holding this icon, or swiping from the right.

**Android**
- Fixed tapping the file name when renaming a file in File Explorer causes the file menu to show up.

**iOS**
- Long-holding buttons that triggers an action (like the three dot menu) now triggers it after holding for 600ms instead of triggering it when the finger is released.
- Fixed app freezing when resuming from another app when using a large vault.
