**Core update**
Includes all new functionality and bug fixes up to Obsidian Desktop v0.13.24.
This update also allows all new cm6-compatible plugins to run.

**Live Preview**
While this feature works pretty well already, it hasn't been fully mobile optimized, so there could still be some usability issues when using with a touch-only device, such as editing embeds and code blocks.
In the meantime, feel free to use Source Mode when that happens. You can do that by long-holding the 3 dot button on the top right and hitting "Toggle Live Preview/Source mode" (or run a command from the pull down menu or bottom toolbar).

**Vim mode**
Support for vim mode is now available, but must be enabled on a per-device basis on mobile. It is not really usable on a mobile device without an external keyboard.

**Others**
Drag and drop features from desktop is now generally available across the app, and can be triggered by long-holding items. This includes drag and drop files and folders, starred items, and outline items.
