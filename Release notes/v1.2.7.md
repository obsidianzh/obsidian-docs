## Improvements

- Added new command "Create new note in current tab."

## No longer broken

- Bookmarks: Better handling of bookmarks when syncing across devices. Should fix issues reported of bookmarks disappearing when using Obsidian Sync.
- Canvas: Fixed two-finger pinching when default wheel behavior is set to "zoom."
- The "rename" modal will no longer report the rename as successful if the rename failed.
