<small>Released March 29, 2023</small>

In this update, we revisited some of our older core plugins and provided more than just a fresh coat of paint. Most notably, the Starred plugin has been removed in favor of its successor: Bookmarks.

- [Bookmarks](#bookmarks) â€” Meet the replacement to the Starred plugin.
- [Obsidian Publish improvements](#publish-improvements) â€”Â New configuration options for your Publish site.
- [Search UI improvements](#search-ui-improvements) â€” The Global Search UI has undergone a refresh.
- [Hotkey settings improvements](#hotkey-settings-improvements) â€” Filter your hotkeys by assigned, unassigned. Even search by hotkey.
- [Misc. improvements](#misc-improvements) â€” Improvements to the quick switcher as well as new commands for controlling tabs.

## Bookmarks

ðŸ‘‹ Say goodbye to the Starred core plugin. Say hello to **Bookmarks**.

Bookmark just about anything in Obsidian: files, folders, graphs, searches, headings, blocks. Organize your bookmarks in the much more robust **Bookmark view**. Reorder bookmarks with drag-and-drop. Create _Bookmark Groups_ to organize your bookmarks into collapsible sections.

## Publish Improvements

We've put a lot of love into [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) recently. Some of those improvements are only available in Obsidian v1.2 and above.

In the Publish modal, there is a new configuration menu "Site Options â†’ Components â†’ Customize Navigation." From the view, you can reorder the pages in your sidebar as well as hide pages or folders from the navigation list. Hidden pages will still be published and accessible via `[[wikilinks]]`.


## Search UI improvements

We've reorganized the Search UI to make things more intuitive and make room for more options. Like being able to bookmark search queries right from here:

## Misc. improvements

- Added "Close tab group" command as well as option to close a tab group from the tab group dropdown menu.
- The ribbon context menu will now show the ribbon icons next to each menu item to make it easier to identify which ribbon items are enabled/disabled.
