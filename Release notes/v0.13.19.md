## No longer broken

- Fixed automatic numbering of lists doesn't stop at the end of the list and accidentally changes the numbers of lists further down the document.
- Fixed sometimes undo/redo combines multiple consecutive operations like typing and pasting into a single change.
- Fixed when redoing a change, the cursor would be put in the wrong spot afterwards.
- Fixed sometimes bad HTML causes Live Preview to crash with an error.
